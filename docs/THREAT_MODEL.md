# Threat Model & Data Handling Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the threat model and data handling policies for uber-hacksaw, a malware scanner designed with security and privacy as core principles.

## Threat Model

### Assumptions

1. **Host System Trust**: The host system running uber-hacksaw is trusted and not compromised
2. **Network Isolation**: The scanner operates in a controlled network environment
3. **Input Validation**: All inputs (files, directories, network data) are validated before processing
4. **Sandbox Safety**: Dynamic analysis is performed in isolated environments (VMs/containers)

### Threat Vectors

#### 1. Malicious File Processing
- **Risk**: Processing malicious files could lead to system compromise
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Never execute unknown binaries on the host
  - Use isolated environments for dynamic analysis
  - Implement file size and depth limits
  - Validate file types before processing

#### 2. Resource Exhaustion
- **Risk**: Malicious files could cause DoS through resource exhaustion
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement file size limits (configurable, default 100MB)
  - Set processing timeouts for all operations
  - Limit archive extraction depth (default 5 levels)
  - Monitor memory usage and implement caps

#### 3. Data Exfiltration
- **Risk**: Sensitive file contents could be leaked during scanning
- **Mitigation**:
  - Only extract metadata and hashes by default
  - Implement content filtering for sensitive patterns
  - Use local processing only (no cloud uploads)
  - Audit all data access and processing

#### 4. Rule Injection
- **Risk**: Malicious YARA rules could cause system compromise
- **Mitigation**:
  - Validate all rule syntax before compilation
  - Implement rule execution timeouts
  - Sandbox rule execution environment
  - Sign and verify rule bundles

## Data Handling Policy

### Core Principles

1. **Minimal Data Collection**: Only collect necessary metadata and indicators
2. **Local Processing**: All analysis performed locally, no external data transmission
3. **Data Minimization**: Store only hashes, metadata, and detection results
4. **Audit Trail**: Log all data access and processing activities

### Data Types

#### Collected Data
- **File Metadata**: Path, size, timestamps, permissions
- **Content Hashes**: SHA-256, fuzzy hashes (ppdeep)
- **File Type**: MIME type, magic bytes, extension
- **Static Analysis**: PE/ELF headers, imports, sections, entropy
- **Detection Results**: Rule matches, risk scores, confidence levels

#### Excluded Data
- **File Contents**: Raw file data is not stored or transmitted
- **Personal Information**: No PII extraction or storage
- **Network Data**: No network communication during scanning
- **System Information**: No host system details beyond necessary metadata

### Data Storage

#### Local Storage
- **Quarantine**: Isolated storage with integrity verification
- **Audit Logs**: Immutable append-only logs (JSONL format)
- **Cache**: Temporary storage for rule compilation and reputation data
- **Configuration**: Local configuration files only

#### Data Retention
- **Scan Results**: Configurable retention (default 30 days)
- **Audit Logs**: Immutable, permanent retention
- **Quarantine**: Until manual review or automatic cleanup
- **Cache**: Automatic cleanup based on size and age limits

### Data Security

#### Encryption
- **At Rest**: Quarantine files encrypted with AES-256
- **In Transit**: N/A (no network transmission)
- **Keys**: Local key management, no external key services

#### Access Control
- **File Permissions**: Restrictive permissions on all data files
- **Process Isolation**: Run with minimal required privileges
- **Audit Access**: Log all file and data access

#### Integrity
- **File Verification**: SHA-256 checksums for all stored data
- **Log Integrity**: Cryptographic signatures for audit logs
- **Rule Verification**: Digital signatures for rule bundles

## Compliance & Privacy

### Privacy Protection
- No collection of personal information
- No external data transmission
- Local processing only
- User control over data retention

### Regulatory Compliance
- Designed to meet enterprise security requirements
- Configurable for compliance with data protection regulations
- Audit capabilities for compliance reporting

## Incident Response

### Security Incidents
1. **Detection**: Monitor for unusual behavior or resource usage
2. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems and data
3. **Investigation**: Analyze audit logs and system state
4. **Recovery**: Restore from clean backups if necessary
5. **Lessons Learned**: Update policies and procedures

### Data Breach Response
1. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact
2. **Notification**: Inform relevant stakeholders
3. **Containment**: Prevent further data access
4. **Investigation**: Root cause analysis
5. **Remediation**: Implement fixes and improvements

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development
- Security-first design principles
- Regular security reviews and testing
- Minimal privilege execution
- Input validation and sanitization

### Deployment
- Isolated execution environments
- Regular security updates
- Monitoring and alerting
- Backup and recovery procedures

### Operations
- Regular security assessments
- Incident response procedures
- User training and awareness
- Continuous monitoring

## Review and Updates

This threat model and data handling policy will be reviewed:
- Annually or when significant changes are made
- After any security incidents
- When new threats are identified
- When regulatory requirements change
